🚀 Just Deployed My First MLOps Project!
Excited to share the complete implementation of an MLOps pipeline built to predict student depression using machine learning. This project includes:

✅ Data ingestion with MariaDB
✅ Data validation using Great Expectations
✅ Preprocessing with Pandas, Scikit-learn
✅ Model training with Random Forest
✅ Real-time deployment using FastAPI
✅ Monitoring and experiment tracking with MLflow

🔍 The API is live and returns predictions with probability scores, as shown in the image below. This solution was built with ethical AI practices in mind — including k-anonymity and role-based access for data privacy.
